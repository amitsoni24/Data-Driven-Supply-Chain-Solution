## Data-Driven Supply Chain Solution
# 1. About the Dataset
- This project focuses on analyzing supply chain data for 100 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). The dataset includes various features related to product inventory, transportation routes, and quality control metrics. This comprehensive dataset allows for a thorough examination of the supply chain processes and identification of inefficiencies.

# 2. Objective
**The primary objective of this project is to analyze the supply chain data to:**
- Identify inefficiencies within the supply chain.
- Recommend improvements to enhance overall performance.
- Optimize key aspects such as stock levels, transportation costs, and demand forecasting.

# 3. Approach
**The project approach involves the following steps:**
- **Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilized correlation and pairwise plots to analyze feature distributions and relationships.
- **Product, Route Transportation, & Quality Control Analysis:** Examined product details, transportation routes, and quality control metrics to assess and mitigate risks.
- **Optimization of Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):** Optimized EOQ for SKUs to improve inventory management.
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Applied machine learning models for stock management, transportation cost, and demand forecasting.
- **Sales Forecasting:** Achieved an RMSE of 37% using the LightGBM model.
- **Route Optimization:** Employed a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to suggest optimal transportation routes.
- **Evaluation of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Assessed KPIs to gauge the performance and effectiveness of the supply chain.

# 4. Results & Key Features
- **Sales Forecasting:** The LightGBM model demonstrated an RMSE of 0.37, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting sales.
- **Route Optimization:** The KNN model provided optimized routes, contributing to better transportation efficiency.
- **Key Performance Indicators:** Evaluated various KPIs to monitor and enhance supply chain performance.
